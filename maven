 Maven Build Lifecycle 
The Maven build follows a specific lifecycle to deploy and distribute the target project.

There are three built-in lifecycles:

default: the main lifecycle, as it’s responsible for project deployment
clean: to clean the project and remove all files generated by the previous build
site: to create the project’s site documentation
Each lifecycle consists of a sequence of phases. The default build lifecycle consists of 23 phases, as it’s the main build lifecycle.
